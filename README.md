## Dao Van Manh's README

Hi, I'm Dao Van "Dan" Manh. Please call me "Dan" for short.
I'm living at Tokyo, Japan.

In previous decade, I had worked as a backend engineer (mostly) Japanese companies, where I focused on Fintech domain, especially payment systems. I have a
passion for creating clean architectures and making things work (then making people happy).

This page describes the most efficient ways to work with me.
Please feel free to contribute to it by opening a merge request.

## Values

I moved into backend because I care that things submitted from clients can be verified, modified and worked here. That means I have to understand the business logics, also the big picture of the whole system.

I value _openness, ownership, and trust_, and I will give you mine.

For _openness_, I value and welcome _diversity of thought_, and not all ideas need to be good
ones either. We're still all better off discussing them than not.

For _ownership_, I believe that ownership makes us to think about the work carefully, and take the quick action without hesitance.

For _trust_, I believe that only trust can makes us work together in long time. The relationship bases on trust are very solid, and it demands both to believe in each others. 

## My communication style

I'm striving for [honest yet
caring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Candor) discussions and I expect
the same in return. English is my second language, and we may have more
cultural barriers than we know; I will not take offense from open feedback, but
I might miss subtle cues.

Setting expectations, i.e. communicating what's expected of me and what I can
expect of you, makes for efficient comms with fewer misunderstandings. This
includes telling me how _you_ like your communications!
### When in doubt, overcommunicate

- I won't know what you don't tell me about. But please also include _why_ you
wanted my attention: is there an _action_ I should take?

- I still _care_, I just need my notes. Please remind me if I forgot a detail
  :-/ 

### Informal coffee chats

I'm a fan! Schedule a coffee meeting so
we can understand each other better.  All free slots in my calendar are fair
game. I also welcome meeting in person.

## My working style

I work through enabling and empowering my team, building trust and catalyzing
discussions. Grab me for backup, if need be.

Talk to me about technology. While most of the engineering should be done by
engineers, I very much enjoy discussing technical issues, and believe that
[managers can have a little coding as a
treat](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cats-can-have-a-little-salami). I have
seen various design patterns work or fail in interesting ways (and on large
scale) over the years, and I'm happy to learn something and/or share what I
know.

*Corollary*: I will sometimes offer ideas or seem to nitpick while you know
better. If _you got this_ and want me to step back, please let me know, no
offense will be taken.
